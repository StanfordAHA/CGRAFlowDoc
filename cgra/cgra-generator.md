CGRA generation should happen *first* as it dictates the design
information that will be used by all succeeding steps (except the
Halide front end, which compiles to design-independent intermediate
form).

[TODO: description of  build_cgra.sh script, what it does, how to use it etc.]

### Usage


`git clone https://github.com/StanfordAHA/CGRAGenerator`<br/>
`CGRAGenerator/hardware/generator_z/top/build_cgra.sh`
