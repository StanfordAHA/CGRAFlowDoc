* Transition to fault Tester library for portability
* Integration with garnet (TBG name change proposal: fracture)
* Improve interface for handling inputs and outputs (no more pre/post
  processing, generalize over input/output file data widths)
* Generalize over bitstream input (file) to simplify compilation process
* Produce formal verification collateral from bitstream to configure chip,
  prove properties on configured chip
* Prepare for bringup
