# Introduction to the Test Bench Generator

The Test Bench Generator is a Python script that produces a C++ Verilator
harness for testing the RTL generated by CGRAGenerator.

The generated harness is specalized to a bitstream, uses file based IO,
supports tracing (waveforms), and two modes for configuration the CGRA
(`use_jtag`).

The generator relies on IO collateral (`.io.json`) produced by PnR to specify
the mapping between inputs/outputs to pads (including the reset pin).

It also includes pre and post processing scripts for input and output files
for the CGRAFlow integration test bench.
